## Best performing model:
### The most acurate model is Random Forest due to the lack of noise in the data.

## Unscaled Data
The Random Forest Classifier had a score of 61.8% vs. Logistic Regression's score of 52.5% making RFC the better performing model.

These results align with my prediction that Random Forest would be more accurate.

## Scaled Data
After scaling the Logistic Regrssion model score was 72% and Random Forest was 62%.

These results dispute my prediction because once the data was scaled Logistic Regression performed better.
